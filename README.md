# Blissful Silence #

The "Web 2.0" movement is all about user-generated content. That's great.
Unfortunately when it comes user-generated _comments_, the result is usually
asinine, ignorant, racist, cynical, depressing, spam, or generally infuriating.
If you're like me and you [can't look away][1], this extension can be a
blessing.

* No more comments
* No more likes
* No more share counts
* No more +1s
* No more popularity metrics in general

Just content.

## Why Use This Extension? ##

There are other comment blocking extensions out there. What makes this extension
different?

1. Having a "show comments" button is like bringing a beer to an AA meeting, why
   have it there if you don't want to use it? The only way to show comments with
   this extension is to go to your settings and disable it entirely.
2. Likes, +1s, and other popularity measures can also be distracting. Who cares
   if millions of people hate a Youtube video that you like? This extension
   attempts to remove all such distractions.

## Techincal Details ##

As far as I know, there is no silver bullet for comment removal. Thus this
script uses a bunch of site-specific CSS rules to hide unwanted content. If a
site you visit is unaffected by this extension, you can [let me know][2] and
I'll see what I can do. [Contributions][3] are also welcome.

Some sites (such as Facebook) do not provide a way to easily single out content
for removal, so not all content will be blocked.
